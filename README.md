The Flappy Bird Java Project is a popular recreation of the classic mobile game "Flappy Bird" using Java programming. It is often developed as a beginner-friendly project to practice game development, object-oriented programming (OOP), and GUI (Graphical User Interface) concepts. The project is typically built using libraries like Java Swing or JavaFX for rendering graphics and handling user input.

Key Features of the Project:
Game Mechanics:

The player controls a bird (or any object) that must navigate through gaps between pipes.

The bird falls due to gravity, and the player can make it flap (jump) by pressing a key or clicking.

The game ends if the bird hits the ground, ceiling, or pipes.

Components:

Bird: The main character controlled by the player.

Pipes: Obstacles that move from right to left.

Background: A scrolling background to create the illusion of movement.

Score Counter: Tracks the number of pipes successfully passed.

Technologies Used:

Java Swing/JavaFX: For rendering the game window and handling graphics.

Event Listeners: To detect user input (e.g., spacebar or mouse click).

Game Loop: To continuously update the game state (e.g., bird position, pipe movement).

Code Structure:

Main Class: Initializes the game window and starts the game loop.

Bird Class: Handles the bird's movement, gravity, and flapping.

Pipe Class: Manages the creation, movement, and collision detection of pipes.

Game Panel: Renders the game objects (bird, pipes, background) on the screen.

Customization:

The project can be extended with additional features like:

High score tracking.

Different difficulty levels.

Sound effects and animations.

Multiplayer mode.
